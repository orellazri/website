Hi! I'm a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new technologies, and of course, Arctic Monkeys üêí.

I'm currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at [Wix](https://wix.com).

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
