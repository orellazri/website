# Welcome

I'm Orel Lazri, a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new technologies, and of course, a huge fan of Arctic Monkeys.

I'm currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at [Nexxen](https://nexxen.com).

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have
previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
