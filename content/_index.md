# Welcome 👋🏻

I'm Orel Lazri, a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new technologies, and of course, Arctic Monkeys 🐒.


I'm currently working as a DevOps Lead at [Nexxen](https://nexxen.com).


I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
