Hi! I'm a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new technologies, speciality coffee ☕, and of course, Arctic Monkeys 🐒.

I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
