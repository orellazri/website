One area where efficiency matters greatly is in deploying application configurations. Developers often need to make changes to configuration values based on different environments, like production, staging, or development.\nUnderstanding the Setup\nAt the core of this approach is the idea of storing application configuration values directly within the application's repository. You create YAML files for each environment, like prod.yml or sandbox.yml, and populate them with the necessary key-value pairs for different configurations.\nThese key-value pairs will then be used to update the relevant ConfigMap file in the GitOps repository.\nExample of a configuration yaml file:\n\nExample of the resulting ConfigMap in the GitOps repository (after the data has been updated):\n\nBenefits of Managing Configurations Alongside Code\nThe beauty of this approach is that it puts the power in the hands of developers. They can make changes to application-specific configurations directly in the repository without needing approval from DevOps teams. This speeds up the development cycle and allows teams to respond quickly to evolving requirements.\nAutomating ConfigMap Patching\nTo automate this process, we can use a script that scans for YAML files within a deployment-configs directory in the application repository. If it finds any, it updates the corresponding application_configmap.yml file in the GitOps repository with the data from these YAML files. This means that any changes made to the YAML files in the application repository are automatically reflected in the GitOps repository, simplifying the deployment process significantly.\n\nThis script assumes that yq is installed and that an environment variable named ENV exists and is set to the desired environment (e.g., prod, staging). This should be defined in the relevant CI step.\nThis will effectily update the ConfigMap in the GitOps repository with the values from the YAML files in the application repository.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/application-specific-configuration-gitops/","title":"Application Specific Configuration with GitOps Deployments"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/beginning-smart-home-journey-zigbee/":{"body":"In the last few weeks, I've been wanting to make my home smarter, in an efficient and secure way.\nI wanted to add smart devices that won't have access to my local network or to the internet, so I won't have to worry about separating my network and messing things up security-wise.\nThat's where I stubmled upon Zigbee and got into this rabbit hole.\nWhat is Zigbee?\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nZigbee is a ... specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, ... designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence, Zigbee is a low-power, low-data-rate, and close proximity (i.e., personal area) wireless ad hoc network.\n\nWhat that means for me is that my Zigbee-powered smart devices can be on a network of their own, with no access to the internet (since they don't receive IP addresses).\nWhat do I need?\nFor this to work, I need:\n\nZigbee-powered smart device (obviously)\nZigbee coordinator\nSome computer/SoC to run my software on\n\nFor the smart device, I started with a smart plug. For the coordinator, I bought a Sonoff ZBDongle-E which is a USB dongle with an antenna. For the computer, I have a small NUC that's running some of my services that need to run locally. A Raspberry Pi sort of device will also do the trick.\nAs for the software, I chose to run Zigbee2MQTT which is a bridge that uses my USB dongle to connect to my Zigbee devices. Then, it can be added to Home Assistant/Homebridge/etc.\nGetting to It\nFirst of all, my specific USB dongle needed to be flashed with a newer firmware version to support the Ember protocol which is the non-deprecated one. To do that, I used Silabs Firmware Flasher which can easily flash that firmware over the browser. The other alternative is to disassemble the dongle and do something a bit more tricky, which I haven't tried because the first way worked for me.\nAfter doing that, I deployed a simple Docker Compose stack with both Zigbee2MQTT and an MQTT broker (I'm using Eclipse Mosquitto:\n\nNote that you'll need to find your USB dongle's ID in /dev/serial/by-id/...\nAfter doing that, navigate to Z2M's (short for Zigbee2MQTT) web UI and make sure everything works.

I wanted a tool that I could give a high-level goal to, like \"refactor the auth service,\" and have it autonomously navigate my codebase, understand its nuances, and execute the task, seamlessly integrated with the company's self-hosted GitLab instance.\nThe Vision: A Hands-Off AI Collaborator\nThe goal was to create a system where I could delegate complex tasks to an AI agent. The agent needed to be able to check out the right code, have the right tools and credentials, and understand project-specific instructions to get the job done. I also needed a simple web interface to submit these tasks and monitor their progress.\nTools like OpenAI Codex and Cursor Background Agents already exist, but they are only available with GitHub and come with limitations. In my case, we are using a self-hosted GitLab instance in our company, so we wanted seamless integration with our existing infrastructure, with a user-friendly wrapper and additional features.\nFor the purposes of this post, I'll be referring to this system as \"Agent\", even though we have a different internal name for it.\nThe High-Level Architecture\nI decided to split the system into the following primary components:\n\nBackend Server: A Go application that manages tasks and orchestrates the AI agents.\nWeb Application: A React and TypeScript interface for creating and tracking tasks.\nRuntime: A Docker image that contains the agent and all the tools it needs to execute the tasks.\n\nThis separation of concerns keeps the architecture clean and scalable. The frontend is focused purely on user interaction, while the backend handles the heavy lifting of agent execution.\n\nThe Implementation\nThe Orchestrator\nThe heart of the system is the Go backend. When a new task is submitted, the backend doesn't run the agent itself. Instead, it dynamically creates and dispatches a Kubernetes Job.\nI chose this approach for a few key advantages:\n\nIsolation: Each agent runs in its own sandboxed container.\nScalability: Kubernetes can handle running multiple jobs in parallel.\nResilience: Kubernetes provides robust error handling and reporting.\nObservability: Our Kubernetes clusters are already orchestrated with our observability stack, so we get metrics and logs collection out of the box.\n\nThe Go server exposes a simple REST API, constructs the Kubernetes Job, injects the necessary context (prompt, Git info, API keys), and monitors the job's status.\nEach task has the following structure:\n\nI used the kubernetes/client-go library to interact with the Kubernetes API. This means loading the Kubernetes config from either the in-cluster config or from a file, creating new jobs, monitoring their status, etc.\nI keep track of the created tasks in an in-memory list wrapper with a sync.Mutex to ensure thread-safety, but this will later be replaced with a database.\nThe Runtime\nThe Kubernetes Job runs the specific runtime Docker image. This container is the environment where the AI agent lives. It's equipped with all the tools it needs:\n\nGit command-line tools.\nAPI credentials for services like GitLab, Jira, and Coda, and Anthropic.\nClaude Code and MCP servers.\n\nThe user's prompt is passed directly as a command-line argument to the agent process inside the container.\nFollowing is a sample Dockerfile for the runtime:\n\nAnd the entrypoint script:\n\nAs you can see, the entrypoint script takes care of the following:\n\nSetting up the GitLab credentials.\nSetting up Claude Code &amp; MCP servers.\nCloning the repository.\nRunning the project-specific setup script. This is needed to install dependencies, run database migrations, or set up any other project-specific tooling.\nCreating a new branch.\nRunning the agent with the prompt.\nPushing the changes to the repository.\nCreating a merge request.\n\nThe Frontend\nThe frontend is a straightforward application built with Vite &amp; React. A form allows the users to input the three key pieces of information for a task:\n\nPrompt: The high-level instruction for the agent.\nRepository: The path to the Git repository.\nBranch: The specific branch to check out (optional).\n\nOnce a task is submitted, it appears in a table that shows its status and auto-refreshes. Clicking a task streams the logs directly from the Kubernetes pod, which is crucial for seeing what the agent is doing.\nProject-Specific Context\nOne of the most powerful features is how the system understands the context of a specific project. It does this by looking for two special files in the root of the target repository:\n\n\nagent-setup.sh: A shell script the agent executes first. I use this to install dependencies (e.g. pnpm install), run database migrations, or set up any other project-specific tooling.\n\n\nCLAUDE.md: A Markdown file with instructions for the AI model itself—a \"meta-prompt\" that guides the agent. Here, I can specify which test commands to use, coding style guidelines, or things the agent should not do.\n\n\nThis mechanism makes the system incredibly flexible without requiring any changes to the orchestrator itself.\nA User's Journey\nLet's walk through a typical use case.\n\nThe Request: I want to add a health check endpoint to my new web service.\nThe Setup: In the service's repository, I create a CLAUDE.md file for general-purpose project instructions that says, \"This project uses Go. All new endpoints should be added in server.go and include a unit test.\"\nThe Submission: I go to the web UI and create a new task with the prompt, \"Add a /health endpoint that returns a 200 OK status,\" along with the repository and branch.\nThe Orchestration: The Go backend creates a Kubernetes job.\nThe Execution: The agent starts, clones the repo, reads the CLAUDE.md file, and then edits server.go to add the endpoint and a corresponding test.\nThe Monitoring: On the UI, I can see the status change from pending to running and watch the logs.\nThe Completion: Once the agent commits and pushes the code, the job completes, and the UI updates to completed.\n\nConclusion\nBuilding this AI agent orchestrator has been a fascinating project, combining Go, React, Kubernetes, and LLMs into a practical tool. Using Kubernetes for execution makes the system scalable and robust, and the project-specific context files make the agent highly adaptable.\nThis project has shown immense value to the organization in both cost and time savings. It's sometimes best used as the first step toward implementing a complex feature, and at other times it manages to deliver the feature in a fraction of the time.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/building-my-own-ai-agent-orchestrator/","title":"Building My Own AI Agent Orchestrator"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/deploying-aws-eks-cluster-with-terraform/":{"body":"In this post, we'll walk through the process of deploying an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using Terraform. We'll cover everything from setting up the basic infrastructure to configuring the cluster and its node groups. Let's dive in!\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nSetting Up the Terraform Configuration\nNetworking Configuration\nEKS Cluster Configuration\nNode Group Configuration\nIAM Permissions\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\nAmazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane. In this guide, we'll use Terraform to automate the deployment of an EKS cluster, including all necessary networking and security configurations.\nSetting Up the Terraform Configuration\nFirst, let's set up our main Terraform configuration file. This file will define the AWS provider and some default tags for our resources.\nCreate a main.tf file, and inside it, add the following configuration:\n\nIn this configuration:\n\nWe specify the AWS provider and its version.\nWe set the AWS region to us-east-1.\nWe use an IAM role for authentication (replace &lt;ACCOUNT_ID&gt; with your actual AWS account ID and &lt;ROLE&gt; with your actual role name).\nWe define default tags that will be applied to all resources created by Terraform.\n\nAfter creating this file, run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.\nNetworking Configuration\nNext, let's set up the networking infrastructure for our EKS cluster. This includes creating a VPC, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, and route tables.\nCreate a new file named networking.tf and add the following configuration:\n\nThis configuration sets up:\n\nA VPC with a CIDR block of 10.43.0.0/22 (You can use any CIDR block you prefer)\nPublic and private subnets in two availability zones\nAn Internet Gateway for public internet access\nA NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets\nRoute tables for public and private subnets\nA security group allowing outbound traffic\n\nEKS Cluster Configuration\nNow, let's define our EKS cluster back in the main.tf file:\n\nThis configuration:\n\nCreates an EKS cluster named &lt;CLUSTER_NAME&gt;\nUses both private and public subnets\nEnables private endpoint access and disables public endpoint access\nUses the internal security group we created earlier\nSets up API server authentication using both Kubernetes API and ConfigMap\n\nNode Group Configuration\nNext, let's set up the EKS node group. Create a new file named nodes.tf and add the following configuration:\n\nThis configuration:\n\nCreates a launch template for EC2 instances with a 50GB gp3 EBS volume\nSets up a node group with 3 t3a.large instances in the private subnets\nUses On-Demand instances for the node group\n\nIAM Permissions\nFinally, let's set up the necessary IAM roles and policies. Create a new file named permissions.tf and add the following configuration:\n\nThis configuration:\n\nCreates IAM roles for the EKS cluster and node group\nAttaches necessary policies to these roles, including the EKS cluster policy, worker node policy, CNI policy, and ECR read-only policy\nCreates a custom policy for the EBS CSI driver and attaches it to the node role\n\nConclusion\nIn this guide, we've walked through the process of deploying an Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform. We've covered setting up the basic infrastructure, configuring the EKS cluster, setting up node groups, and managing IAM permissions.\nBy using Terraform, we can version control our infrastructure and easily replicate this setup across different environments.

While most platforms offer cloud recording, searching through hours of audio for that one key decision made three meetings ago remains a painful experience. This led me to build Essence, a fully local command-line tool that transcribes meeting audio and generates structured summaries without sending any data to external services.\nThis project builds on my previous exploration of local AI with Rust - RAG Pipeline to Chat with My Obsidian Vault, where I first dove into running AI models locally for privacy and performance.\nThe Problem\nMeeting recordings pile up quickly, but finding specific information requires listening through entire recordings. What I needed was something that could:\n\nConvert audio recordings to searchable text\nGenerate concise summaries highlighting key decisions and action items\nWork entirely offline for privacy and speed\nIntegrate seamlessly into my existing CLI-based workflow\n\nI did not want to use/pay for any cloud services that join the meetings for me (**cough** [Some Stupid Name] The Note Taker **cough**), and I wanted to use my own hardware.\nTechnical Architecture\nEssence is built in Rust and follows a modular design with two primary components: transcription and summarization. I'm using OpenAI's Whisper model running locally via the whisper-rs crate for speech recognition, and Ollama for local language model inference. Everything runs entirely on my machine - no data ever leaves my system, which you know I love.\nI achieved good results by using Apple's Metal acceleration for the Whisper model (ggml-large-v3.bin), and the gemma3:27b model from Ollama for summarization. On my M4 Pro, transcribing a and summarizing a 45-minute meeting took less than 8 minutes (your mileage may vary).\nTranscription\nThe transcription module wraps Whisper's C++ implementation, handling the complex audio preprocessing required for speech recognition.\nWe first have to read the wav audio file (using hound) into a vector of 16-bit integers.\n\nThe Whisper model expects 16KHz mono f32 samples, meaning we have to do just a bit more work:\n\nAfter that's done, we can run the model and get back a vector of text segments. Et voila!\nSummarization\nThe summarization component interfaces with Ollama to run large language models locally. The model parameters are tuned for consistent, focused output - low temperature reduces randomness while constrained sampling ensures the model stays on topic.\nThe prompt engineering focuses on extracting actionable information:\n\nUnix Philosophy and CLI Design\nI designed Essence to follow Unix principles: do one thing well and play nicely with other tools. The CLI exposes two primary commands that can be chained together or used independently:\n\nFollowing Unix conventions, the tool outputs results to stdout and logs to stderr. This makes it perfect for scripting and automation. Here's a script that takes a locally recorded meeting video and produces a summary:\n\nNow imagine running this script after each meeting, saving the result in your Obsidian vault, and then chatting with it using the fully-local RAG pipeline I previously built.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/fully-local-meeting-ai-summaries/","title":"Fully Local AI Meeting Summaries"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/ingress-nginx-eks-internal-loadbalancer/":{"body":"In this post, we will deploy Ingress Nginx on EKS with an internal load balancer and HTTPS.

I started writing a controller and a service for each model, but I quickly realized that I was writing the same code over and over again.\nSurely there must be a better way to do this.\nGo Generics to the Rescue\nGo 1.18 introduced generics, which allows you to write functions and data structures that can work with any type.\nThis is perfect for my use case. I can write a generic controller and service that can work with any model, as long as the input and output are the same as the model struct. This of course won't work for every use case, but for simple CRUD resources, it's perfect.\nThe Models\nLet's start by defining a simple model named Post under models/models.go:\n\nNote that each field has a bson tag for MongoDB and a json tag for the API.\nA Naive Approach\nHere's what a naive controller and service would look like for the Post model:\n\nAnd the service:\n\nWe can clearly see how repetitive this code is. We can do better.\nA Generic Approach\nService\nWe'll start out by defining a generic service that can work with any model:\n\nThis service accepts the collection name as a parameter so it knows which collection to work with.\n\nThis is the generic service struct. It accepts a type T which can be any type (in our case, a Post model).\n\nThe functions are defined with the same type T that the service struct accepts, so in this context everywhere you see T, think of it as the Post model.\nController\nAs for the controller, we will define a generic controller that will contain the service:\n\nThis controller registers the routes for the CRUD operations and calls the service methods. Note that I'm using Echo as my web framework of choice, but this will work with any other web framework or router.\nTying It All Together\nIn the main file, where we start our HTTP server and connect to the database, we can now use the generic controller to create a controller for the Post model:\n\nHere you can see how scalable this approach is. You can create as many controllers as you want for different models, and you don't have to write any more service or controller code, unless you need to add custom logic.\nGenerics are a powerful feature that can help you write more scalable and maintainable code. In this example, we used generics to create a generic CRUD service and controller that can work with any model. This approach is perfect for simple CRUD resources, but it might not work for more complex use cases.\nThis is a simple example, and I can easily see use cases where the controller and service can be extended to handle more complex logic like pagination, filtering, and more.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/mongodb-crud-api-go-generics/","title":"Implementing a MongoDB CRUD API Using Go Generics"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/patching-helm-with-kustomize/":{"body":"Helm deployments are a great way to manage Kubernetes resources, but sometimes you need to customize or extend the resources that Helm generates. In this post, we'll look at how you can use Kustomize to patch and extend Helm resources.\nWhat is Kustomize?\nKustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes resources. It allows you to define a set of patches that can be applied to existing resources, and it provides a way to extend resources with additional configurations.\nExample Scenario\nWhen you deploy a Helm chart, it generates a set of Kubernetes resources based on the templates defined in the chart. If you need to make changes to these resources, you can use Kustomize to apply patches.\nFor example, let's say you have a Helm chart that deploys a Deployment resource with the following configuration:\n\nIf you want to change the number of replicas to 5, you can create a patch file like this:\n\nGenerating Helm Manifests with Kustomize\nHow do you make sure that this patch is applied to the Deployment resource generated by the Helm chart? You can use Kustomize act as the generator for the Helm chart and apply the patch to the generated resources. That means that Kustomize will download the Helm chart into plain YAML files and patch them. Then, you can apply the patched resources to your cluster.\nStart by creating a kustomization.yaml file. Here is an example of a Bitnami Airflow deployment:\n\nCurrently, this file only specifies the Helm chart to use and the values file to apply. No patches or additional resources are defined yet.\nTo generate the resources from the Helm chart, run the following command:\n\nThis tells Kustomize to download the Helm chart, generate the resources, and output them as plain YAML files. You can then apply these resources to your cluster.\nApplying Patches with Kustomize\nNow that we've established that Kustomize can generate resources from a Helm chart, let's look at how you can apply patches to these resources.\nCreate a patch file (patch.yaml) that changes the number of replicas in the Deployment resource (note that I'm using my-airflow just as an example of a resource, you should replace it with the actual name of the resource you want to patch):\n\nNext, add the patch to the kustomization.yaml file, so it looks like this:\n\nNow, when you run kustomize build --enable-helm, the patch will be applied to the resources generated by the Helm chart.\nExtending with Kustomize\nIn addition to patching resources, you can treat the kustomization.yaml as you would normally, where you can treat it as a base and apply additional overlays, add more resources on top of the generated ones, add annotations, etc.\nUsage with Argo CD &amp; GitOps\nIf you're using Argo CD for GitOps, you can use kustomize with the --enable-helm flag to enable Kustomize to generate Helm manifests.\nWe are currently using Argo CD Vault Plugin to deploy resources, so I modified our ConfigManagementPlugin to look like this:\n\nBut depending on your setup, you might need to adjust this to fit your needs, or create a similar plugin yourself.\nI've also read that patching the argocd-cm ConfigMap resource and adding kustomize.buildOptions: --enable-helm might work, but I haven't tested it myself since we are using the above plugin for building the manifests.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/patching-helm-with-kustomize/","title":"Patching and Extending Helm Resources With Kustomize"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/rag-pipeline-chat-with-my-obsidian-vault/":{"body":"My Obsidian vault has grown significantly over time with snippets, project documentation, meeting notes, and random thoughts. I wanted a conversational way to interact with my notes - to ask natural language questions like \"How did I fix that Git submodule issue?\" or \"What were the main challenges in the refactor?\" and get contextual answers from my notes.\nRather than relying on cloud-based solutions, I decided to see if I could build my own RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline that runs entirely locally, keeping my notes private and giving me full control over the implementation - mainly for fun.\nYou can find the source code here.\nA Local RAG Pipeline\nI built mdrag (Markdown RAG), a Rust-based CLI tool that creates a searchable vector database from markdown files and uses local AI models to generate responses. The name might not be the most creative, but it gets the job done!\nThe system works in two phases:\n\nEmbedding: Process all markdown files, chunk them intelligently, and generate vector embeddings\nQuerying: Take natural language queries, find similar content, and use a local LLM to generate answers\n\nThe Implementation\nThese are the main interesting dependencies I've used:\n\nrusqlite and sqlite-vec for using SQLite as a vector database\nollama-rs - This allows me to interact with a local Ollama instance in an idiomatic way instead of writing and parsing plain requests\nzerocopy - For zero-cost memory manipulation. This is used to reference data in and out of SQLite without memory allocations.\n\nFirst step: Markdown Parsing and Chunking\nOne of the trickiest parts was intelligently chunking markdown content. Simply splitting by character count would break apart related information. Instead, I implemented a parser that is slightly more sophisticated, though it could still be improved significantly:\n\nDetects the primary header level used in each document\nSplits content by those headers, keeping related information together\nHandles edge cases like content before the first header\nFurther splits large chunks while respecting paragraph boundaries\n\n\nThis approach ensures that a section like \"## Git Snippets\" stays together with all its related commands, making retrieval more meaningful.\nSecond step: Vector Embeddings with SQLite\nInstead of using a dedicated vector database, I leveraged sqlite-vec, a SQLite extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities. This keeps the entire system self-contained-no additional services to run or manage.\nThis extension can be loaded with a short unsafe block:\n\nAnd then we can create a table with the following schema:\n\nThe embedding process walks through all markdown files in the vault, checks if they've already been processed (to avoid redundant work), and generates 768-dimensional vectors using Ollama's nomic-embed-text-v1.5 model. Using a different model means that the embedding vector size will probably need to be changed.\nThird step: Querying the vector database\nIn querying mode, a user enters a natural language query, and the system generates an embedding for it, then uses the vector database to find the most similar chunks. Finally, it uses the LLM to generate a response.\nThe interesting part where we fetch the similar vectors from SQLite is this:\n\nI used the embedding MATCH clause to find the most similar vectors to the query embedding, and return the contents (the original text that was embedded). This then lets the LLM generate a response based on the context of the most similar chunks.\nFor the actual text generation, I integrated with Ollama, which provides a simple API for running various models locally. I chose gemma3:1b because I wanted an extremely lightweight model to test things quickly.\n\nThe streaming interface provides immediate feedback, making the tool feel responsive even when the model is working on complex queries.\nUsage\nLet's walk through a typical interaction:\n\n\nInitial Setup: I run mdrag embed ~/vault to process all my markdown files. This creates embeddings for each chunk and stores them in the SQLite database.\n\n\nQuerying: When I want to find something, I run mdrag search \"how to debug git ssh issues\". The system:\n\nGenerates an embedding for my query\nFinds the most similar chunks from my notes\nConstructs a prompt with the query and context\nStreams the AI-generated response\n\n\n\nGetting Results: Instead of just showing me raw search results, I get a conversational answer that synthesizes information from multiple sources in my vault.\n\n\nFor example, querying about Git SSH debugging would pull relevant snippets from my Git.md file and provide a comprehensive answer with the exact commands I've used before.\nThe system can also be modified to act as a chatbot, where users can ask follow-up questions and the system will use the context of the previous conversation for responses.\nLocal-First Approach\nRunning everything locally has several advantages:\n\nPrivacy: My notes never leave my machine - this is crucial for vaults that contain sensitive information like work-related notes\nCost: No API costs for embeddings or inference (other than electricity 😅)\nReliability: Works offline and doesn't depend on external services\n\nThe performance is surprisingly good. Initial embedding takes a few seconds, and subsequent queries are nearly instantaneous. The SQLite vector search is remarkably fast, and the 1B parameter model provides good results without requiring expensive hardware.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/rag-pipeline-chat-with-my-obsidian-vault/","title":"RAG Pipeline to Chat with My Obsidian Vault"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-hosting-hetzner-vm-terraform-ansible-docker/":{"body":"I started my self-hosting journey a few years back with a single desktop machine serving as both my NAS and the host for all the services I was running.\nI found out the hard way, that sometimes it's not the best decision to have the important things that need to be always available running in my home, since they are doomed to experience downtime (power failures, ISP maintenance, and whatnot).\nAfter deciding that I want my critical services (like paperless for document management, Nextcloud for cloud storage, and Immich for my photos and videos) to endure as little downtime as possible, I started looking for a relatively cheap solution - a VM and block storage.\nHetzner proved to be the the best solution I could find. They have unbeatable prices for ARM based VMs, and storage boxes that you can mount via CIFS, for as little as ~3€/mo.\nI also took this opportunity to get more familiar with Terraform, and to build my infrastructure declaratively.\nUsing Terraform to provision cloud resources\nAfter signing up to Hetzner, you'll need to log in to your cloud dashboard and create a project. A project is a separation that you can have between different, well, projects. This is a good time to pick a name for this rabbithole we're going down in.\nThen, go ahead and generate an API token (under Security), name it terraform, and give it both read and write permissions.\nCreate a repository and inside a terraform directory. The main.tf file will look similar to this:\n\nThis file basically provisions your firewall and VM. In my case, I made sure to add my public SSH key to the VM so I can SSH into it as soon as it's done provisioning. I also opened ports 80 and 443 in the firewall so I can have my domain name pointing to the VM.\nMake sure to change the values accordingly (such as the name and server type for your VM).\nThe other files you'll need is variables.tf:\n\nhcloud_token is your API token, which will of course not be committed into your git repository, hence it's empty. When running Terraform, you can add a --var-file=secrets.tfvars which will point to a separate variables file that will contain the actual API token and will not be checked in to the repo.\nIn my setup, I also added the remote-exec and local-exec provisioners so it runs my Ansible playbook automatically after the VM is up, but I left it out as an exercise to the reader ™.\nNow it should be as simple as running terraform init to initialize the directory, then terraform plan to view the planned changes, and terraform apply --var-file=secrets.tfvars to apply the changes and provision the resources.\nUsing Ansible to set up the VM\nI'm using Ansible to manage the configuration of my VM - my bash scripts, Docker compose files, cronjobs, packages, etc.\nCreate a directory named ansible next to the terraform directory. Inside it, create a playbook with a name of your choice (site.yml, vm.yml, or whatever):\n\nThis basically calls the vm roles. Go ahead and create the following file: roles/vm/tasks/main.yml\nNow, it's really up to you to build this role to your liking and configure anything you dream of.\nMe, personally? I use it to configure basic stuff (user, group, directories, packages), install Docker &amp; lazydocker, disable root &amp; password ssh authentication and so on.\nHere are some useful tasks that you may find yourself using as well:\nConfigure sshd\n\nInstall Docker\n\nInstall lazydocker\n\nSynchronize docker compose directory\n\nMount Hetzner Storage Box\n\nIt's really handy to use ansible-vault to manage secret variables.\nCrafting Docker compose files\nYour next step will be to actually run the services you want. For that, you'll need Docker compose files. I like to keep them in the Ansible role templates/stacks directory, and use Ansible's templating engine to fill in secret variables such as tokens and passwords.\nHere are some compose files that can come in handy (make sure to change the variables and volume mounts accordingly):\nNGINX Proxy Manager\n\nNextcloud\n\nAccessing the VM from outside\nThe safest option to access your VM from outside the cloud network is using a VPN. You can self host Wireguard with wg-easy or use Tailscale (recommended).\nIf you want your services to be publicly accessible, you'll need to set up a reverse proxy which will map subdomains to your services which are exposed on certain ports (for example, to access your Nextcloud instance, you'll visit nextcloud.mylab.com instead of mylab.com:8082).\nI do a mix of both. I like using Tailscale to access services that I don't need exposed to the internet, and that I don't mind connecting to the VPN for, like Netdata, and I use Nginx Proxy Manager as a reverse proxy for other services that I want to access from anywhere without a VPN.\nFYI, there are other solutions which I won't cover here like Cloudflare tunnels. Do your research if this seems right for you.\nReverse proxy\nFirst you'll need to purchase a domain. I recommend heading over to TLD-List to look for a cheap TLD (you probably don't need .com or .ai for your cheap lab).\nAfter that, I like to change the DNS nameserver for the domain from the domain registrar's to Cloudflare, simply because I like their UI and their API.\nSet an A record for @ (root) to your VM's IP address, and set a CNAME record for * to point to @, so any subdomain will also point to the VM.\nThen in your reverse proxy of choice, you can map each subdomain you want to a service, along with an SSL certificate.\nFinal words\nI hope you found this writeup useful. I tried to only write about the general gist of things without going into many details, but also without being too brisk and missing critical points. Self-hosting can be intimidating at first, but once you experiment with it, and try things out, it's not too scary.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-hosting-hetzner-vm-terraform-ansible-docker/","title":"Self Hosting On a Hetzner VM: Terraform, Ansible, Docker"},"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-serve-gitlab-ci-cd-templates/":{"body":"Empowering developers to manage their own CI/CD pipelines is crucial. We are seeing a lot of advancements in the platform engineering areas, providing self-serve systems, which means it must be working!\nAt Nexxen, We've implemented a robust system using custom-made GitLab CI/CD templates that allows developers to build and manage their own pipelines effortlessly. This self-serve system not only accelerates the development process but also ensures consistency and best practices across all projects.\nIn this blog post, I'll walk you through how we achieved this, including our self-documenting system that generates documentation for all CI/CD templates.\nThe Power of GitLab CI/CD Templates\nGitLab CI/CD templates are reusable steps that can be included in multiple projects. By creating a library of these templates, we provide developers with a set of predefined jobs and stages that they can easily include in their .gitlab-ci.yml files.\nThis approach ensures that all pipelines adhere to the company's standards and best practices, and allows the operation teams to roll out company-wide changes and improvements.\nThe Inner Workings\nWe constructed a monorepo that consists of all our CI/CD templates, defined in respective YAML files, and a root.yml file that includes all our templates and defines common variables and stages, like so:\n\nAnd an example of a step template:\n\nShameless plug: We use Render Kit to render templates, which is a handly tool that I developed, check it out!\nExample of Using Templates\nFor developers to use our templates, all they have to do is create steps that extend the template, like so:\n\nDevelopers can also extend these templates to add additional steps or override existing values. For instance, if a developer wants to build a Maven-based project with a specific image of Maven and apply additional rules, they can extend the template and specify a custom Docker image:\n\nSelf-Documenting System\nTo make it easier for developers to understand and use our templates, we built a self-documenting system. Each template is annotated with metadata in the form of commented YAML. This metadata is parsed and used to generate markdown documentation that describes each template.\nHere's an example of a template with metadata annotations:\n\nWe developed a tool in Go that reads the template directories, parses the metadata from the templates, and generates markdown files, which we then serve using MkDocs.\nEach template can include documentation for optional and requires variables, stage definition, and more.\nThe resulting documentation shows how to use each template, with practical examples and explanations.\nThe output, when rendered by MkDocs, looks like this:\n\nBy implementing generic templates in GitLab, we have empowered our developers to build and manage their own CI/CD pipelines. This self-serve system not only accelerates the development process but also ensures consistency and best practices across all projects.\n","id":"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-serve-gitlab-ci-cd-templates/","title":"Empowering Developers with Self-Serve GitLab CI/CD Templates"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/coda-mcp/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/coda-mcp/","title":"Coda MCP"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/github-backup/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/github-backup/","title":"GitHub Backup"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/parcels/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/parcels/","title":"Parcels"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/renderkit/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/renderkit/","title":"Render Kit"},"https://orellazri.com/projects/todoist-backup-exporter/":{"body":"","id":"https://orellazri.com/projects/todoist-backup-exporter/","title":"Todoist Backup Exporter"}},"docInfo":{"https://orellazri.com/":{"body":32,"title":2},"https://orellazri.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://orellazri.com/posts/application-specific-configuration-gitops/":{"body":181,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/beginning-smart-home-journey-zigbee/":{"body":252,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/building-my-own-ai-agent-orchestrator/":{"body":649,"title":4},"https://orellazri.com/posts/deploying-aws-eks-cluster-with-terraform/":{"body":398,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/ebpf-development-on-apple-silicon-macs-using-lima/":{"body":152,"title":7},"https://orellazri.com/posts/fully-local-meeting-ai-summaries/":{"body":339,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/ingress-nginx-eks-internal-loadbalancer/":{"body":144,"title":8},"https://orellazri.com/posts/mongodb-crud-api-go-generics/":{"body":257,"title":7},"https://orellazri.com/posts/patching-helm-with-kustomize/":{"body":297,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/rag-pipeline-chat-with-my-obsidian-vault/":{"body":546,"title":5},"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-hosting-hetzner-vm-terraform-ansible-docker/":{"body":563,"title":7},"https://orellazri.com/posts/self-serve-gitlab-ci-cd-templates/":{"body":267,"title":7},"https://orellazri.com/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://orellazri.com/projects/coda-mcp/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://orellazri.com/projects/github-backup/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://orellazri.com/projects/parcels/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://orellazri.com/projects/renderkit/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://orellazri.com/projects/todoist-backup-exporter/":{"body":0,"title":3}},"length":20},"lang":"English"}
