    <p>
      I'm Orel Lazri, a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new
      technologies, and of course, Arctic Monkeys 🐒.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://wix.com" target="_blank">Wix</a>.</p>
    <p>
      I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have
      previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
