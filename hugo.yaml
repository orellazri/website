      I'm Orel Lazri, a software engineer with a passion for open source software, Linux, homelabs, exploring new technologies, and of course, a huge fan of Arctic Monkeys.
      <br /><br />
      I'm currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://nexxen.com/" target="_blank">Nexxen</a>.
      <br /><br />
      I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or am currently, working on in my spare time.
